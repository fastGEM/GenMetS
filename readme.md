## GenMetS: Genetic determinants for Metabolic Syndrome
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex trait linking to cardiometabolic diseases, yet largely been studied for its component traits. Here we explored genetic determinants of MetS in a cohort of 1368 mid-aged Asian women, examining ~100K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The resulting polygenic MetS model (GenMetS), comprised of 7850 weighted SNPs, was validated in 365,495 individuals from the UK Biobank, 2,310 individuals from an Asian cohort, and 1073 offspring from the discovery cohort. Beyond risk scores from single trait, GenMetS can explain 5-12% of MetS in Asian women of varying ages and nationalities, with reduced performance in males and the European population. Importantly, the model exhibited predictive capabilities, anticipating the onset of cardiometabolic diseases 20-30 years in advance, based on the observation of odd-ratios significantly greater than 1 in type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure. Integrated with lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, GenMetS achieved 69.3% accuracy in predicting cardiometabolic multimorbidity. The heritability of GenMetS was also validated through associations with obesogenic growth patterns in children. Our findings underscore a persistent genetic signature for metabolic traits across women's lifespan, transmitted to their offspring.
